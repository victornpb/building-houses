The Lazy Farmer Flag Game
-------------------------

My fork of the game, I implemented A.I. in the game to try to solve it using a Genectic Algorithm to solve it.

The aim is to place flags on a field of length 1, so that when you divide the field into equal-sized plots, there's exactly one flag in each field. To complicate matters, you place the flags one-by-one, and you check whether the placements are valid after each flag goes down.
